# ü§ñ Jokester C-3PO
This is a personal project I've developed on my own and entirely for fun.\ 
The frontend is built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, while the backend is structured with Node and Express.

## ü¶¥ The backbone of this website relies on two APIs
1) The [JokeAPI](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/ "JokeAPI") developed by [Sv443](https://github.com/Sv443 "Sv443"), which I use to get the random jokes. 
2) The [FakeYou API](https://docs.fakeyou.com/#/ "FakeYou API") developed by [Echelon](https://github.com/echelon "Echelon"), which I use to get the C-3PO voice model that reads the joke with text to speech (TTS) technology.

## ü§∑ It isn't perfect
It's been merely two months since I've started programming with JavaScript and its libraries and frameworks. I'm still a youngling, so you may encounter some errors. Also, I don't currently own an API key for the FakeYou API, so you might have to wait to 20s for the TTS to popup. It may also crash if you ask for several jokes on a row. Master Yoda will make sure you know when you must stop and wait for a minute or two until the rate limit timeout ends.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning
If you don't choose a specific joke category, you will get a random joke of any kind. If you're susceptible to dark/black/offensive humor, *please* make sure to select any other category than **Dark** or you might get an offensive joke randomly displayed.
