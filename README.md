# Jokester C-3PO
This is a personal project I've developed on my own and entirely for fun. 
The frontend is built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, while the backend is structured with Node and Express.

## The backbone of this web is based on two APIs:
1) The JokeAPI by Sv443 to get the random jokes. [Link](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/ "JokeAPI")
2) FakeYou API by Echelon to get the C-3PO voice model that reads the joke with TTS.
